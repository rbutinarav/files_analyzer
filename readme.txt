#The code of this project has been largerly created by Codex.
#The description of the code below has been writtern entirely by OpenAI.
#
#This code is an interactive data loader and analyzer for CSV files. It contains
#a loop that allows the user to select a CSV file from a folder, load its data, 
#and analyze the data. The code also contains parameters to initialize the session
#state, such as file_names_loaded, file_list, data_loaded, selected_files, show_preview
#and show_statistics. It also contains a main loop that allows the user to select a file
#from a select box, and a button to load the data. Once the data is loaded, it shows the
#first 1000 rows of the file and the number of unique and duplicated values per column.
#It also allows the user to select a column to show the duplicated values.
#
#The execute the code:
#1.load the files you want to analyze in the folder dataset (or run gensampledataset.py to generate a sample dataset)
#2.check the dependencies in requirements.txt and install them if necessary
#3.type "streamlit run main.py"
